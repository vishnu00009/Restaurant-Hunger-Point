# Project: Restaurant Page

**Live version** of the site can be found [here](https://renchester.github.io/top-restaurant/)

This project is a mock-up of a page for an imaginary restaurant -- KARI HOUSE Manila (Kariman). Developed as a practice for webpack module bundling.

The site has three modules:

1. _*Home Page*_
   Displays basic information about the restaurant and allows returning to the home page;

2. _*About Page*_
   Displays company information and restaurant history;

3. _Menu Page_
   Displays the selection of dishes and beverages available in the restaurant;
